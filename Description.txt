This mod is inspired by mods like ValheimPlus that give you the possibility to adjust almost every setting to your preference. I wanted to make the start of a game slower and make a lot of gameplay options (like smashing of ATMs etc.) more valuable. 

[b]Enabling required[/b]
Lithium consists of several modules that can be toggled by setting the value of "Enabled" in the corresponding configuration file. All configuration files are saved in "/UserData/Lithium/" in separate JSON files. All setting files are created with default values when first starting a game with this mod. All modules are disabled per default and you need to enable them by changing the configuration file.

[b][size=3]Value types[/size]
Weighted Values
[/b]You can provide lots of values and give each of them a weight. They are put in a random picker, but when picking an item, items with a higher weight are preferred, according to their relative weight. You can use this to make something like: 80% of the times give me option A, 15% option B and 5% option C. The weights do not have to add up to 100%, this is calculated internally automatically.

[b]Weighted Normalized Values
[/b]Similar to WeightedValues, but only works for numeric values. Internally, they are use to create a curve using the given weights and then pick a random value on this curve. Allows you to get values inbetween of individual weighted values.


[quote][b]﻿[/b][size=3][b]Module "Customers"[/b][/size]
[i]ConfigFile: customers.json[/i]

[b]Description[/b]
Make customers preferred effects more relevant. Once you've reached a rank of "Hoolum II", customers will only order products from you or your dealers, if at least one of their desired effects is provided by the product. They will send you a message listing their desired effects (and the name of their dealer if appliccable) if there is no suitable offer. Products providing multiple of their effects are preferred (using a weighted random). 
When providing samples to customers, the same requirements apply, but you get a percentage bonus for each level of quality you exceed their required quality standards. Makes getting new customers a challenge and feels much more rewarding.

[b]Inspired by
[/b]I tried and played a lot of mods in Schedule I and some have inspired my to do things for Lithium.
[list]
[*]BetterStacks by zarnes - great mod and has more options (like working for deliveries etc.). Give it a try!
[*]TrashGrabberPlus by Elio - Great idea and even updates the percentage on the item and makes the TrashGrabber has infinite capacity. If you love collecting trash, you should definetely get this mod!
[*]Ovens Cook Faster by lasersquid - apart from loving the username, this game the idea to modify the usage times of most stations. Never tried this mod on it's own, but was inspired by it. So if LabOvens are a pain to you, give lasersquid some support!
