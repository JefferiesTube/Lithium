Welcome to the Lithium Mod Documentation
Lithium is a modular balancing framework. Tweak systems like Employees, Plants, Machines, and more. Prevent runaway profits and resource overflow. Each feature is optional and fully toggleable. Designed for refined progression and customizable gameplay control. This mod is inspired by mods like ValheimPlus that give you the possibility to adjust almost every setting to your preference. I wanted to make the start of a game slower and make a lot of gameplay options (like smashing of ATMs etc.) more valuable.
